		We do not care about unused classes, methods or arguments.
		Filters and hooks often offer a huge amount of variables which won't be used in most cases.
		Methods might be attached to callbacks (like hooks/filters) and not accessible by PHPMD.
		Also we like to leave the door open for test methods which are just a preview or sketch.
